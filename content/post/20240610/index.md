Imagine if you could go back in time but that you couldn't change anything about the events from the past up to the 
present. What moment would you go back to?

I was first introduced to the short story collection, _Before the Coffee Gets Cold_ by Toshikazu Kawaguchi, a couple 
years ago by a friend from Boston. It is a moving series of stories of love, honesty, growth, and living in faith and without regrets. I happened to read it again recently, and since my friend mentioned that she never got the chance to 
blog about her own thoughts on the book, and I felt compelled this time around to compile some thoughts of
my own.

For context, without spoiling the plot, the general premise of the book is a cafe that allows people to travel in time. 
However, there are many rules about the circumstances under which one can travel. The most important rules include
the following:
1. you will not be able to change any events that have already happened up to the present (e.g. you can't convince 
   someone to not leave somewhere, you can't prevent death, etc.);
2. you can only travel to another time in the cafe and cannot leave a specific seat from which you can time travel;
3. there is only a specific time (or set of times) in each day, determined by certain circumstances, during which you
   can time travel (said circumstances are explained in the book but not important to discuss here);
4. you have a limited amount of time under (the amount of time for the coffee to get cold) during which you can travel 
   back; and
5. you can only travel once.

As a result of this and more conditions, most people who are originally compelled by the idea of time travel are 
turned off by its many conditions, but there are a few who find a second chance in the cafe's secret. Each of the 
4 stories is centered around different forms of love, including between lovers in various stages of life and
family. In each case, the person traveling back has a second opportunity to speak to their loved one, to say what they
couldn't at the time. While they cannot change their past, they can change their own heart and how they live the future.

At face value, the story is weird: why would anyone go back in time if they couldn't rewrite their past? Except for beautiful memories of the past, rarely would I ever want to go back to relive a painful memory or a mistake of mine. I do that enough in my own memory, nevermind in real life. ðŸ˜… Yet the power of the story comes from the fact that each character travels back in time for one last goodbye because there is no other hope of reconciliation. In that hope, they succeed not in changing their own circumstances but rather in changing their own hearts. We cannot rewrite our stories, nor should we try to. They are a part of our journey and identity, but they do not have the final word on how we choose to live from here. We can let those stories drag us into hopelessness, or we can find redemption and a second chance to live in hope and joy.

The parallels, to me, between the cafe and the Christian narrative are striking. The constraints of the time traveling 
cafe mean that not everyone gets to travel back. It is a lesson in appreciating that we aren't owed second chances and 
that they should not be taken for granted. Likewise, not everyone who hears the Gospel will understand or receive it. 
This as much is true in the parable of the sower from Jesus (Matthew 13). Some will hear it and not believe they need it 
or that it could even be real. Others will believe but be snatched away by other desires or will have no ability to 
endure, but a few will hear it and bear fruit. Everyone is given this opportunity, but not all will receive it. In our 
life with God, he chooses out of love to give us a second chance at life, but our of his grace and mercy and not because 
we deserve it. For me, it is easy to assume, just as God calls Jonah a second time after runninng away, that God will 
just give me second and more chances to follow him even when I am disobedient. While he is gracious in that way, I've 
realized that it is not for me to take for granted but to seize fully the moment to say "yes" when he first calls.

But receiving the Gospel does not mean we get to rewrite our sins in this life. What Jesus does for us is not to forget that our sins existed but to acknowledge them and forgive us in spite of them. The gospel rewrites not our past circumstances but our hearts in how we choose to live going forward. At the end of the road, when we do face judgment, it will not be our ledgers by which we are judged but by Jesus's. In general, we have very little control over the circumstances of our lives and the people around us, as much as we may like to delude ourselves. What we can do is live in humility, accept the grace that is offered to us, and seek to live with a heart posture oriented toward love, joy, and reconciliation. When we do that, then we too will be able to time travel back in the cafe just like the characters of the story.
