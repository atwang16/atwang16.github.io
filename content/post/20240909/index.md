Every so often I reminisce about the old days of competing in FTC, and I like to think about which game(s) I wish I could do again. This especially comes up with every new game, especially as I have been volunteering as a referee and judge for now my sixth year. Since I've been recently in the mood for thinking about tier lists, I thought it would be fun to make one for all of the FTC games!

# Criteria

The primary criteria I am considering for my ranking of games is the following:
* **Strategic diversity**. There should ideally be multiple roles that a robot can play in a match, with a range of technical skill required for each role. Robots should be able to complement each other, rather than everyone just performing the same tasks. Having one singular strategy that every robot executes in a match is less interesting than having robots that play different strategies.
* **Design creativity**. The game design should allow for competitive creative solutions. That is, there either should be one or a couple unique solutions that no team thought of or are very hard to pull off but yield a strong competitive advantage, or many similarly viable but different solutions. If there is too much design convergence to one clearly optimal solution, then the game is no fun.
* **High ceiling**. It should not be easy to achieve the optimal design. If the maximum score is consistently achievable, then there is no reason to improve. Reaching the maximum before time also makes a game boring for the audience after the team is done.
* **Macro**. A good game involves not just a good design but also good decision-making while in the match. Without tactics, the game mostly devolves into a skill game with minimal interaction and need to change plans (as long as nothing breaks).
* **Relevant autonomous**. Beyond the mechanical achievements of the robot, good controls should yield a significant advantage to a team. To build the right skills, autonomous routines should be consequential to the game.
* **Fun**. No rules or strategies should make it so hard for a robot to play the game that they can't effectively do anything.
* **Danger**. The game should be relatively safe for drive teams, referees, and audience members.

My formula for this will roughly be \[0.14SD + 0.28DC + 0.25HC + 0.23M + 0.04RA + 0.04F + 0.02D\].

There are some additional criteria when it comes to thinking about the tasks of the referees and resources needed to practice the game outside of competitions, but it is a bit hard to judge these for games I did not participate in, so I won't explicitly rate them unless it 
* Secondary criteria:
  * **Penalties**. It should not be hard for referees to rule on penalties, and teams should generally be winning based on scores moreso than penalty points.
  * **Easy to score**. It should not be hard for the referees to score a game. The fewer judgment calls that need to be made during the game for (live) scoring, the better.
  * **Simple field setup**. Ideally, to keep FTC cost-effective for lower income teams and easy to assemble for new teams, the field should be relatively constrained to the standard field size and not be too difficult for a team to setup such a field. It is advantageous if the team can build their own replica or work with only a half field.

I'll score each criteria on a scale from 1 to 5 and compute an overall rating for each game based on weighted importance.

Summary of scores:


## 2011-2012 Bowled Over!

The objective of the game was to move a bowling ball to specific field locations, place racquetballs in plastic crates, and lift the crates as high as possible.
* Strategic diversity: 4 - There was more role diversity in lower levels of competition than in the highest levels, at which point lifting crates as high as possible was the clear way to score points. The process of scoring crates themselves was complex enough to result in complex sequences of gameplay. Teams also did have mildly interesting autonomous routines, and some even in the elims tried cooperative or defensive strategies.
* Design creativity: 5 - While there were certainly shared elements, there was a huge variety of robot designs and approaches for how crates and racquetballs were scored. This is hands down the best game in all of FTC for creative designs.
* High ceiling: 5 - There was no theoretical maximum score this year, so teams were only limited by the physical 18" starting cube and the ceiling of the facility.
* Macro: 4 - There was not a lot of macro needed in the scoring sequence, but for the chaotic field, teams did need to make a lot of decisions regarding how many crates to collect, where to collect them (crates and racquetballs), guarding against defense, and so on.
* Autonomous: 2 - Auto was mildly interesting but largely inconsequential when it came to score. The most useful part of autonomous was probably just positioning the robot to best perform tele-op tasks, especially because the racquetballs made navigating the field exceptionally difficult, and robots playing defense could shut down even the best teams.
* Fun: 3 - The game definitely had some shut-down potential between defensive robots and the chaos of the field, i.e. racquetballs everywhere. I think a better driver could somewhat outplay their opponents or use the protection of the floor zone to their advantage.
* Danger: 1 - This game was also the most dangerous out of any in FTC, given that a robot at 10 feet high falling over could actually hurt someone lol. And yes, they did fall over.

Final score: 4.28

## Ring It Up!

The objective of the game was to collect rings from dispensers and play tic-tac-toe on two back-to-back grids in the center of the field. There was also a robot lifting component.
* Strategic diversity: 3 - Similar to *Bowled Over!*, in that there was definitely strategic convergence toward the higher levels. The main two roles were scoring rings or playing defense. Since there were two tic-tac-toe boards, though, there was no real fighting over roles among an alliance. On the other hand, the task of lifting your partner's robot could have been dropped from the game, and no one at worlds probably would have cared.
* Design creativity: 4 - There was slightly less design diversity compared to *Bowled Over!* but still many different implementations I can remember from how teams played autonomous, collected rings, and scored them (individually or together).
* High ceiling: 4.5 - Because alliances were effectively fighting for control over different pegs (effectively a zero sum game), two strong alliances could not play each other and hit the maximum score without the other threatening to take it away. In an imbalanced game, a team could probably score near the maximum though with time remaining.
* Macro: 5 - This game was important for macro, since teams were effectively fighting each other for control of pegs.
* Autonomous: 4.5 - Auto was fairly consequential, less for the points it would get a team and more for the uncontested ownership it would get them by scoring it.
* Fun: 2 - Defense was a menace. One robot could relatively easily shut down another from scoring, and the only saving grace was that they could not score at the same time.
* Danger: 4.5 - Fairly low risk of danger in this game, except maybe robot contact while trying to get rings from the end of the field.

Final Score: 4.165

## Block Party!

The objective of the game was to collect blocks from corner zones and score them in crates on a seesaw such that it remained balanced. Robots could also raise a flag and perform a pull-up at the end of the match.
* Strategic diversity: 4 - This game had a greater range of tasks, though the best teams were expected to just perform them all. Since there were two sides to the seesaw and two zones, robots were effectively always playing on their size of the seesaw and mostly interacting at the block collection, unless they were playing some form of defense.
* Design creativity: 3.5 - There were creative designs here but less than Bowled Over! and Ring It Up! Some of the interesting designs affected optimizations for collecting and scoring blocks quickly, and some teams had unique ideas for performing the pull-up.
* High ceiling: 4 - Teams could get very close to scoring every single block at worlds, but most games were kept fairly interesting to the end.
* Macro: 4 - This game had some macro in terms of when to switch tasks in end game and how to keep the pendulum balanced, but with good alliances, they could effectively just score as much as they wanted to and not worry too much about the seesaw becoming unbalanced.
* Autonomous: 4 - Auto could become interesting since robots had to interact while parking on the bridge. The score was perhaps more consequential than prior seasons.
* Fun: 4 - As far as I remember, there weren't too many strategies employed to try to shut down another team, and the rules weren't too stringent on what teams could or could not do.
* Danger: 5 - Low risk of danger to humans.

Final Score: 3.88
